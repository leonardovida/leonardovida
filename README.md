# Hi I'm `Leonardo` - RE @ UU

<!--
**leonardovida/leonardovida** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

- 🔭 I’m a research engineer at @[UtrechtUni](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity) working on projects spanning different areas from humanities to social science and biology. Currently, I'm working on an NLP pipeline, computation biology and pure data engineering. I have a bias towards practice and creating OSS data-driven solutions that can have an impact on society.
- 😍 My (current) favorite topics are Big Data analysis and applied machine learning, data pipelines and APIs.
