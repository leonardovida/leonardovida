- I am a Research Engineer at @[UtrechtUni](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity) working on large research projects spanning different areas. Currently, I am: 
  - Leading a team of 3 for an NLP project aimed at creating multiple transformer models on millions of Dutch newspaper articles.
  - Engineering the backend of a software for screening academic papers with machine learning techniques @[ASReview](https://github.com/asreview/asreview).
  - Building a complex data pipeline for internal exam-related data retrieval.
- I have a bias towards practice and creating machine learning and data-driven solutions that can have an impact on society. I am very interested in Big Data analysis, putting machine learning models into production, data pipelines and APIs.
