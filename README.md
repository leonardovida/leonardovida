# Hi I'm `Leonardo` - RE @ UU

- I am a research engineer at @[UtrechtUni](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity) working on projects spanning different areas from humanities to social science and biology. Currently, I am working on multiple large scale research projects spanning from an NLP pipeline to train BERT models on millions of newspaper articles to engineering the backend of a software for screening academic papers with machine learning techniques. I have a bias towards practice and creating machine learning and data-driven solutions that can have an impact on society.
- I am currenlty interested in Big Data analysis and applied machine learning, data pipelines and APIs.
