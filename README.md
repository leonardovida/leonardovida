👋 Hi, I'm `Leonardo`, a Data Engineer, builder and movie lover.

✍️ I enjoy building products and solving data problems at scale. I mainly code in Python but I often use Typescript.

💡 I enjoy creating side projects using 2-2-2 and I'm all-in using LLMs (OpenAI mainly). I'm currently building `[cv-copilot](https://github.com/leonardovida/cv-copilot)` (a product to match candidates with job descriptions using LLMs to provide 10X more insights than comparable methods). Whenever I have time I continue developing `companio`, a RAG-based trip planner and a chrome extension to search semantically across open browser pages. 

🇳🇱 I'm currently based in Amsterdam (NL) and I ideally prefer a hybrid workplace, but I also appreciate remote collaboration.

📽️ I watch too many movies (check out my [letterboxed](https://letterboxd.com/leonardovida/)!) and organize weekly projections of classics and gems across Amsterdam's many independent (and often hidden) "projection rooms". DM me for more info about it!
