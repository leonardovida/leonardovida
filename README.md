👋 Hi, I'm `Leonardo`, and welcome to my GitHub bio.

✍️ I'm a Data Engineer building data platforms within data mesh systems, mainly in Python but occasionaly also in Go

💡 I enjoy creating side projects, currently building [nearit.io](https://www.nearit.io/) (hosting community-sourced and ML-enhanced Google Maps list of places across many of the world's main cities) and summy.ai (a `davinci-003`-based FAQ app dedicated to universities)

🇳🇱 I'm based in Amsterdam, NL but I fully appreciate remote collaboration (when done thoughtfully)

✈️ I love movies, I organize weekly projections across Amsterdam's many independent (and semi-hidden) "projection rooms"
