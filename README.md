# Hi I'm `Leonardo`

**leonardovida/leonardovida** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a research software engineer at @[UtrechtUni](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity) working on projects spanning different areas from humanities to social science and biology. Currently, I'm working on an NLP pipeline, computation biology and pure data engineering. I have a bias towards practice and creating OSS data-driven solutions that can have an impact on society.
