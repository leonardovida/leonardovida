👋 Hi, I'm `Leonardo`, a Data Engineer, builder and movie lover.

✍️ I enjoy building data platforms and solving data problems at scale. I mainly code in Python but for my project I also often use Typescript (Next.js).

💡 I enjoy creating side projects using 2-2-2 and I'm all-in using LLMs (OpenAI mainly). I'm currently building `companio`, a RAG-based trip planner. Whenever I find time I continue to develop [nearit.io](https://www.nearit.io/) (hosting community-sourced and ML-enhanced Google Maps list of places across cities, which generated the idea for `companio`), `summy` (a website to convert universities' FAQs into chatbots) and a chrome extension to search semantically the current webpage. Most (if not all) of these repositories are currently private.

🇳🇱 I'm based in Amsterdam (NL) and I ideally prefer a hybrid workplace, but I also appreciate remote collaboration.

📽️ I like movies (check out my [letterboxed](https://letterboxd.com/leonardovida/)!) and organize weekly projections of classics and gems across Amsterdam's many independent (and often hidden) "projection rooms".
